QT4 Core
Run the following installation line:
sudo apt install libqt4-designer libqt4-opengl libqt4-svg libqtgui4 libqtwebkit4
I believe this is only needed for the Daisy GUI. If you run the custom DAQ program, this is not needed.

libusb 1.0
For me on Ubuntu 18 this already worked without doing anything.
If not, then perhaps this works:
sudo apt-get install libusb-dev
